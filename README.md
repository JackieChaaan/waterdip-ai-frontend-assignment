#  Hotel Booking Data Dashboard
This project is a front-end dashboard built with React.js to visualize hotel booking data. The dashboard provides insights into adult and child visitors over time, allowing users to filter by date range and view dynamic, real-time updates to the data visualizations. The project includes several key features:

  1. Chart Visualizations: Includes line charts and sparkline visualizations for tracking the total number of adult and child visitors.
  2. Theming Support: Dark and light mode toggling using a custom ThemeContext, enhancing the user experience.
  3. Dynamic Filtering: Supports date-range filtering, dynamically updating the charts to reflect the selected timeframe.
  4. Component Organization: Key components for data fetching, chart rendering, and theming are organized for modularity and maintainability.
     
#  Technologies Used
  1. React.js: Front-end framework for building the component-based UI.
  2. ApexCharts: Used for rendering charts and visualizing data in a dynamic and interactive way.
  3. Context API: Manages theming across the application, enabling seamless dark/light mode toggling.
#  Usage
  1. Clone the repository and install dependencies using npm install.
  2. Run the application with npm start.
  3. Interact with the dashboard to filter data by date and toggle between light and dark themes.
  4. This project demonstrates the use of React's Context API, state management, and data-driven visualizations to create an engaging data dashboard experience.
